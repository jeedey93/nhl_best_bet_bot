As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I've reviewed the provided information.

**AI Predictions:**
The AI predicted: "No NHL games today" for 2026-02-10.

**Actual Results:**
A full slate of 7 NHL games was played on 2026-02-10.

**Analysis:**
The AI's singular prediction for the day, that there would be no NHL games, was demonstrably incorrect. Since the fundamental premise of the AI's prediction was false, this constitutes a loss in its predictive capability for the day. No individual game picks were made, so there are no specific game outcomes to analyze.

**Summary:**
*   **Total Wins: 0**
*   **Total Losses: 1** (for the incorrect prediction of no games)
