As a disciplined NBA betting analyst, my task is to review the AI's specific predictions against the actual game results to determine wins and losses.

The AI explicitly stated its "NBA Betting Plays" as follows:
1.  **Minnesota Timberwolves vs Atlanta Hawks: Over 246.5**
2.  **Miami Heat vs Utah Jazz: Over 229.5**

However, the "Actual Results" provided are for a different set of games:
*   Indiana Pacers 137 @ New York Knicks 134
*   Los Angeles Clippers 95 @ Houston Rockets 102
*   Dallas Mavericks 111 @ Phoenix Suns 120
*   San Antonio Spurs 136 @ Los Angeles Lakers 108

Since the actual scores for the Minnesota Timberwolves vs Atlanta Hawks game and the Miami Heat vs Utah Jazz game were **not provided**, it is impossible to determine whether the AI's specific betting predictions were wins or losses based on the information given.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**
*   **Total Wins: 0**
*   **Total Losses: 0**
*   **Undetermined: 2** (Due to missing actual results for predicted games)
