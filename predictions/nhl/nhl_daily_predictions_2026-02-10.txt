AI Analysis Summary:
As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, my focus is solely on identifying +EV spots and ignoring games with unclear value. Coin-flip games with tight odds are avoided, and all plays are ranked by confidence.

Here are the top plays:

1.  **Edmonton Oilers (Away) @ Anaheim Ducks (Odds: 1.74)**
    The Oilers are significantly more talented than the struggling Ducks, and at 1.74, the market undervalues Edmonton's probability of securing a road win against a bottom-tier team.

2.  **Vancouver Canucks (Home) vs. Winnipeg Jets (Odds: 2.15)**
    The Canucks have demonstrated strong home-ice advantage and solid overall play this season; getting them as an underdog at 2.15 against a good but not dominant Jets team presents excellent value.

3.  **Toronto Maple Leafs (Away) @ Tampa Bay Lightning (Odds: 2.6)**
    Despite Tampa Bay's strong home record, the Maple Leafs possess an elite offense capable of beating any team, making their 2.6 odds a high-value play if their firepower connects.

4.  **Philadelphia Flyers (Away) @ Washington Capitals (Odds: 2.6)**
    The Capitals are heavily favored, but the Flyers have shown flashes of strong defensive play and goaltending; at 2.6, they offer value for an upset if they execute their disciplined system.
