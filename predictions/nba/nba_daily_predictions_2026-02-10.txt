### NBA Betting Plays

**High Confidence**

1.  **New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers: Indiana Pacers Moneyline**
    MyBookie.ag and BetRivers offer a substantial numerical edge on the Indiana Pacers Moneyline at 1.65 and 1.62 respectively, representing a significant variance from the consensus 1.13-1.16 across other leading bookmakers. This enormous market discrepancy points to a severe undervaluation of the heavily favored Pacers, creating an exceptional expected value opportunity based on a clear bookmaker misprice rather than a situational nuance.

**Leans**

1.  **Phoenix Suns vs Dallas Mavericks: Under 224.5**
    FanDuel presents a favorable total of Under 224.5 at 1.93, a notable 3-point difference compared to other bookmakers listing the line lower at 221.5-223.5 with similar or worse odds. This play capitalizes on potential "Sharp" money pushing the total down elsewhere, suggesting the higher FanDuel line might be an overcorrection to the Suns' favorite status or anticipates a less efficient Mavericks offense.

---

**Games Ignored Due to Constraints:**

*   **Houston Rockets vs Los Angeles Clippers**: The moneyline implies a massive spread (Rockets @ 1.0, Clippers @ 31.0), and there is no "massive" total discrepancy (1.5-point range, standard odds variation) to override the constraint.
*   **Los Angeles Lakers vs San Antonio Spurs**: Similar to the Rockets game, the moneyline indicates a large implied spread, and the total line variation (1.5-point range, standard odds variation) does not constitute a "massive" discrepancy.
