### High Confidence Plays

**1. Toronto Raptors vs Detroit Pistons - Under 222.5 @ 1.98 (DraftKings)**
DraftKings offers a significant pricing outlier at 1.98 for Under 222.5, when other major books are offering 1.91 or less for the same line. Both teams frequently struggle with offensive consistency and the Raptors often play tight defense at home, favoring a lower-scoring outcome.

**2. Houston Rockets vs Los Angeles Clippers - Over 209.5 @ 1.98 (LowVig.ag)**
LowVig.ag stands out with odds of 1.98 for Over 209.5, which is better value compared to the consensus around 1.95 for the same total. The incredibly low total suggests the market might be over-correcting for a defensive battle, creating an opportunity for the total to sneak over.

### Leans

**1. Brooklyn Nets vs Indiana Pacers - Under 215.0 @ 1.98 (LowVig.ag)**
LowVig.ag's 1.98 odds for Under 215.0 offer a strong price point, notably better than other books which have similar or slightly higher totals at lower odds. Despite Indiana's pace, this low total suggests a defensively-minded game, and the value on the Under is compelling.

**2. Philadelphia 76ers vs New York Knicks - Under 221.5 @ 1.95 (BetMGM)**
BetMGM provides good value at 1.95 for Under 221.5, slightly above the 1.91 offered by most other bookmakers for this total. This rivalry often results in a physical, defensive contest, making a lower-scoring game a strong possibility.

**3. Utah Jazz vs Sacramento Kings - Over 231.5 @ 1.95 (BetMGM)**
BetMGM offers an attractive 1.95 on Over 231.5, presenting a higher total at better odds than many competitors who list lower totals at 1.91 or 1.93. Both the Kings and Jazz play at a high pace and are capable of putting up big offensive numbers, making a high-scoring affair likely.
